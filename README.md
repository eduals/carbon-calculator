#Concept:

Want to create a carbon calculator where you input how many miles you drive per day and estimated mpg, etc, and there is a multiple page form that you fill out that you can continuously update and it will tell you your carbon output, equations are all in Ruby on the API end.  Initially followed this great tutorial as an intro to developing AngularJS with Ruby on Rails: https://thinkster.io/angular-rails/

#Technologies:

AngularJS frontend, Bootstrap CSS, HTML5 forms, Ruby on Rails Backend API

#Todos:
- create modal to view and edit footprint model that will be linked to the icon next to co2 output number 
- implement edit account
- implement select feature that will shade the selected footprint in the table and hide the original table headings and display "Edit" and "Delete" buttons instead
